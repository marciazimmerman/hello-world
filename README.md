# hello-world
I'm Marcia Zimmerman of Santa Clara County, California. I'm learning JavaScript. I'd like to:
- code a converter from Canadian to United States dollars;
- write a simple text-based game;
- take over the world.

Some things I have done:
- Taken JavaScript 101 through Girl Develop It.
- Completed these Hour of Code activities:
   - Artist
   - Lightbot

Some things I am doing:
- Working my way through the Codecademy JavaScript class.
- Working my way through the JavaScript for Kids book by Nick Morgan.
 
Some things I for sure will do:
- Take JavaScript 102 and Intro to HTML/CSS through Girl Develop It.

Some things I would like to do that seem awfully hard right now:
- Play with a Raspberry Pi.
- Learn Ruby on Rails.
- Get a job at Netflix working on their asset management for exclusive content.
- Learn and use Jekyll.
- Learn and use the Choice Of Games script to write a text-based game.
